Importing other links and scripts- order of execution

jquery document.ready - why? 

$( document ).ready(function() {

So now lets think about the structure of what we are trying to build.
- What HTML elements best reflect that intent?
- Semantic tags
- https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/
- HTML5
- https://css-tricks.com/semantic-class-names/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML

- advanced topics https://coderwall.com/p/wixovg/bootstrap-without-all-the-debt
(HTMLBase)
